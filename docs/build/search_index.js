This is generally only needed internally by the Regularize operator, so the user doesn't have much need for accessing this directly. The default DDF is the Roma function, which has a support of 3 grid cells. Other choices are the Goza operator, which is a truncated Gaussian with 28 cells support, and the Witchhat, which has 2 cells support. The resulting operator is evaluated with one, two or three coordinate arguments, producing, respectively, 1-d, 2-d, or 3-d smeared delta functions. It can also be called with the usual Julia vectorized dot notation with arrays of arguments.

It also pads each side with a ghost cell. It also determines the indices corresponding to the corner of the cell to which the physical origin corresponds.

The supplied x and y represent physical coordinates of the immersed points, and dx denotes a uniform physical cell size of the grid. The separate arguments x and y can be replaced by a single argument X of type VectorData holding the coordinates.\n\nThe operations of regularization and interpolation are carried out with a discrete delta function (ddf), which defaults to the type Roma. Others are also possible, such as Goza or M3. The optional argument graddir, if set to 1 or 2, will generate an interpolation operator that evaluates the negative of the respective component of the gradient of a grid field at the immersed points. The default value of this argument is 0, which simply interpolates. Note that the regularization form of this gradient type is also possible.\n\nThe optional tuple I0 represents the indices of the primary node that coincides with (x,y) = (0,0). This defaults to (1,1), which leaves one layer of ghost (dual) cells and sets the physical origin in the lower left corner of the grid of interior dual cells.\n\nAnother optional parameter, weights, sets the weight of each point in the regularization. This would generally be set with, say, the differential arc length for regularization of data on a curve. It can be a vector (of the same length as x and y) or a scalar if uniform. It defaults to 1.0.\n\nThe optional Boolean parameter filter can be set to true if it is desired to apply filtering (see Goza et al, J Comput Phys 2016) to the grid data before interpolating. This is generally only used in the context of preconditioning the solution for forces on the immersed points.\n\nIf the optional Boolean parameter issymmetric is set to true, then the regularization and interpolation are constructed to be transposes of each other. Note that this option overrides any supplied weights. The default of this parameter is false.\n\nThe resulting operator can be used in either direction, regularization and interpolation, with the first argument representing the target (the entity to regularize/interpolate to), and the second argument the source (the entity to regularize/interpolate from). The regularization does not use the filtering option.\n\nExample\n\nIn the example below, we set up a 12 x 12 grid. Using the default value for I0 and setting dx = 0.1, the physical dimensions of the non-ghost part of the grid are 1.0 x 1.0. Three points are set up in the interior, and a vector field is assigned to them, with the x component of each of them set to 1.0. These data are regularized to a field of primal edges on the grid.\n\njulia> x = [0.25,0.75,0.25]; y = [0.75,0.25,0.25];\n\njulia> X = VectorData(x,y);\n\njulia> q = Edges(Primal,(12,12));\n\njulia> dx = 0.1;\n\njulia> H = Regularize(x,y,dx)\nRegularization/interpolation operator with non-filtered interpolation\n  3 points in grid with cell area 0.01\n\njulia> f = VectorData(X);\n\njulia> fill!(f.u,1.0);\n\njulia> H(q,f)\nEdges{Primal,12,12} data\nu (in grid orientation)\n11×12 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     8.33333  33.3333  8.33333  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     8.33333  33.3333  8.33333  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\nv (in grid orientation)\n12×11 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"manual/state/#ViscousFlow.Fields.ScalarData","page":"Fields","title":"ViscousFlow.Fields.ScalarData","text":"ScalarData\n\nA wrapper for a one-dimensional array of scalar-valued data.
